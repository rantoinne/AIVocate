## üìã Project Overview

AIVocate Platform is a web-based application that simulates real technical interviews using artificial intelligence. The platform provides candidates with an interactive coding environment where they can practice technical interviews with an AI interviewer that adapts questions based on their performance and provides real-time feedback.

### üéØ Core Vision

Create an accessible, intelligent interview practice platform that:
- **Democratizes interview preparation** - Available 24/7 for anyone to practice
- **Adapts to skill levels** - AI adjusts difficulty based on candidate responses  
- **Provides realistic experience** - Simulates actual technical interview scenarios
- **Offers immediate feedback** - Real-time code analysis and suggestions

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéôÔ∏è AI-Powered Interviewer
- **Natural Language Processing**: Conversational AI that asks follow-up questions
- **Adaptive Questioning**: Difficulty automatically adjusts based on performance
- **Voice Interaction**: Text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities
- **Contextual Responses**: AI understands code context and provides relevant feedback

### üíª Real-Time Coding Environment
- **Live Code Editor**: Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- **Instant Execution**: Secure code execution using Piston API (runs in a sandboxed Docker container on a shared network)
- **Code Analysis**: Real-time feedback on code quality and performance (QwenCoder)
- **Language Support**: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and more

### üé• Interactive Interview Experience
- **Session Recording**: Save interviews for later review
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvement over multiple sessions

### üìä Smart Analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Track coding speed, accuracy, and problem-solving approach
- **Skill Assessment**: Identify strengths and areas for improvement
- **Interview Reports**: Detailed feedback and recommendations
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visual representation of improvement over time
